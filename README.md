What does it do? 
This is a fun alien invasion type game that was adapted from the tutorial in Python Crash Course.

What technologies are used?
It is a Python based game entirely written in the Python programming language. Currently, it only runs effectively while using Spyder.

What is the ambition of the project? 
This project was to develop my software development skills as well as my object-oriented programming skills in a larger program. 

What is the stage of the project? 
It is currently completed up to the point where it is a fun game that my dad can play. I want to add features such as larger ships, different power ups, and varied enemies.

Are there some known issues or things that are not properly done? 
The high score currently does not save after you close down the program.
